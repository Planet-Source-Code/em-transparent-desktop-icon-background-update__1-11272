Run the EXE once and set the text colour of your choice by clicking on the coloured button.

To keep the background transparent constantly, even after desktop refreshes and after
every windows reboot simply create a shortcut to the EXE and add the command line
" -on-h" (no quotations) and place the shortcut in the StartUp folder. It'll load the
program, set the text colour of your choice, keep the background transparent and hide the
program window. To stop the program or change text colour after doing this you'll need to
hit Ctrl-Alt-Del and End Task it.

If you don't know how to create the shortcut simply right click on the one contained in the
zip file (TransDtopIco.lnk), select Properties and change the path
"C:\Program Files\TDI\TransDtopIco.exe" -on-h
to the path where the exe is located on your system.

Be sure to keep tdi.ini in the same folder as the EXE.
